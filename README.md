# Front-End-Banking-Application-Assignment
MIT Assignment for a front end banking application

This is a single page application front end banking application. It used React Hashrouter to navigate from page to page. Since it is a single page application the application is fast due to not having to go back to a server. There is a Home Page, Create Account page, Login, Deposit, Withdraw and a page that shows all created users. I used Bootstrap Navbar and Card components for styling. 

# Installation
To run this program
This program was uploaded to AWS so you can use it at this URL 

# Road Map
Improvements I would add are showing who is logged in at the time and adding a log out button. Also I would like to hide the Deposit and Withdraw links when nobody is currently logged in.
